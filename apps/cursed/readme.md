## The Cursed Maze
A roguelike game in a psudo 3d raycasted world for the Bangle Js 2.

# How to play
- Move Forward: Tap on screen top
- Move Backward: Tap on screen bottom
- Turn Left: Tap on left side of screen
- Turn Right: Tap on right side of screen

Other than movement, and clicking through any dialogue, there is no ther user input required.

In v0.01, Monsters do not chase you. Monster appearance is buggy to say the least. But did I say this game is cursed?

There is an end game, and the game is beatable. I will play through a couple times and balance it if it's too easy.
If you die, the game will automatically close out, and you will have to restart from the beginning.

I borrowed the basic raycasting code concept from here, and made some modifications to make it run better on Bangle JS 2. But I would like to give credit where credit is due as working on this project and Henley's code examples was a real help in learning about raycasting.
